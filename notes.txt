Hello, lets start!

Tokio is using async / await Rust feature

T provides multiple variations of the runtime!

started doing my-redis tutorial

operations that cannot complete immediately are suspended to the background

what is green-threading ?

IS runtime an executor ? or executor is somth else then rt ?
runtime contains async task scheduler, evented I/O, timers
